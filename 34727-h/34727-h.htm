<h2>GEORGE WHITEFIELD.</h2>


<p>There are some men in the pages of history, whose
greatness no person of common sense thinks of disputing.
They tower above the herd of mankind, like
the Pyramids, the Parthenon, and the Colosseum,
among buildings. Such men were Luther and Augustine,
Gustavus Adolphus and George Washington, Columbus
and Sir Isaac Newton. He who questions <i>their</i>
greatness must be content to be thought very ignorant,
very prejudiced, or very eccentric. Public opinion has
come to a conclusion about them&mdash;they were great men.</p>

<p>But there are also great men whose reputation lies
buried under a heap of contemporary ill-will and misrepresentation.
The world does not appreciate them,
because the world does not know their real worth. Their
characters have come down to us through poisoned channels.
Their portraits have been drawn by the ill-natured
hand of enemies. Their faults have been exaggerated.
Their excellences have been maliciously kept back and
suppressed. Like the famous sculptures of Nineveh,
they need the hand of some literary Layard to clear
away the rubbish that has accumulated round their
names, and show them to the world in their fair proportions.
Such men were Vigilantius and Wickliffe. Such
men were Oliver Cromwell and many of the Puritans.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
And such a man was George Whitefield.</p>

<p>There are few men whose characters have suffered so
much from ignorance and misrepresentation of the truth
as Whitefield's.</p>

<p>That he was a famous Methodist, and ally of John
Wesley, in the last century; that he was much run
after by ignorant people, for his preaching; that many
thought him an enthusiast and fanatic; all this is about
as much as most Englishmen know.</p>

<p>But that he was one of the principal champions of
evangelical religion in the eighteenth century in our own
country; that he was one of the most powerful and
effective preachers that ever lived; that he was a man
of extraordinary singleness of eye, and devotedness to
the interests of true religion; that he was a regularly
ordained clergyman of the Church of England, and
would always have worked in the Church, if the Church
had not, most unwisely, shut him out; all these are things,
of which few people seem aware. And yet, after calm
examination of his life and writings, I am satisfied this
is the true account that ought to be given of George
Whitefield.</p>

<p>My chief desire is to assist in forming a just estimate
of Whitefield's worth. I wish to lend a helping hand
towards raising his name from the undeservedly low place
which is commonly assigned to it. I wish to place him
before your eyes as a noble specimen of what the grace
of God can enable one man to do. I want you to treasure
up his name in your memories, as one of the brightest
in that company of departed saints who were, in
their day, patterns of good works, and of whom the
world was not worthy.</p>

<p>I propose, therefore, without further preface, to give
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
you a hasty sketch of Whitefield's <i>times</i>, Whitefield's
<i>life</i>, Whitefield's <i>religion</i>, Whitefield's <i>preaching</i>, and
Whitefield's <i>actual work on earth</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>1. The story of Whitefield's times is one that should
often be told. Without it, no body is qualified to form
an opinion either as to the man or his acts. Conduct
that in one kind of times may seem rash, extravagant,
and indiscreet, in another may be wise, prudent, and
even absolutely necessary. In forming your opinion of
the comparative merits of Christian men, never forget
the old rule: "Distinguish between times." Place yourself
in each man's position. Do not judge what was a
right course of action in other times, by what seems a
right course of action in your own.</p>

<p>Now, the times when Whitefield lived were, unquestionably,
the worst times that have ever been known in
this country, since the Protestant Reformation. There
never was a greater mistake than to talk of "the good
old times." The times of the eighteenth century, at any
rate, were "bad old times," unmistakably. Whitefield
was born in 1714. He died in 1770. It is not saying
too much to assert, that this was precisely the darkest
age that England has passed through in the last three
hundred years. Any thing more deplorable than the
condition of the country, as to religion, morality, and
high principle, from 1700 to about the era of the French
Revolution, it is very difficult to conceive.</p>

<p>The state of religion in the Established Church can
only be compared to that of a frozen or palsied carcass.
<i>There</i> were the time-honored formularies which the wisdom
of the Reformers had provided. <i>There</i> were the
services and lessons from Scripture, just in the same order
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
as we have them now. But, as to preaching the gospel
in the Established Church, there was almost none. The
distinguishing doctrines of Christianity&mdash;the atonement,
the work and office of Christ and the Spirit&mdash;were comparatively
lost sight of. The vast majority of sermons were
miserable moral essays, utterly devoid of any thing calculated
to awaken, convert, save, or sanctify souls. The
curse of black Bartholomew-day seemed to rest upon our
Church. For at least a century after casting out two
thousand of the best ministers in England, our Establishment
never prospered.</p>

<p>There were some learned and conscientious bishops at
this era, beyond question. Such men were Secker, and
Gibson, and Lowth, and Warburton, and Butler, and
Horne. But even the best of them sadly misunderstood
the requirements of the day they lived in. They spent
their strength in writing apologies for Christianity, and
contending against infidels. They could not see that,
without the direct preaching of the essential doctrines
of Christ's gospel, their labors were all in vain. And, as
to the majority of the bishops, they were potent for negative
evil, but impotent for positive good; giants at stopping
what they thought disorder, but infants at devising any
thing to promote real order; mighty to repress over-zealous
attempts at evangelization, but weak to put in
action any remedy for the evils of the age; eagle-eyed
at detecting any unhappy wight who trod on the toes of
a rubric or canon, but blind as bats to the flood of indolence
and false doctrine with which their dioceses were
every where deluged.</p>

<p>That there were many well-read, respectable and
honorable men among the parochial clergy at this period,
it would be wrong to deny. But few, it is to be feared,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>
out of the whole number, preached Christ crucified in simplicity
and sincerity. Many whose lives were decent and
moral, were notoriously Arians, if not Socinians. Many
were totally engrossed in secular pursuits; they neither did
good themselves, nor liked any one else to do it for them.
They hunted; they shot; they drank; they swore; they
fiddled; they farmed; they toasted Church and King,
and thought little or nothing about saving souls. And
as for the man who dared to preach the doctrine of the
Bible, the Articles, and the Homilies, he was sure to be
set down as an enthusiast and fanatic.</p>

<p>The state of religion among the Dissenters was only
a few degrees better than the state of the Church. The
toleration which they enjoyed from William the Third's
time was certainly productive of a very bad spiritual
effect on them as a body. As soon as they ceased to be
persecuted, they appear to have gone to sleep. The
Baptist and Independent could still point to Gill, and
Guyse, and Doddridge, and Watts, and a few more like-minded
men. But the English Presbyterians were fast
lapsing into Socinianism. And as to the great majority of
nonconformists, it is vain to deny that they were very different
men from Baxter, and Flavel, and Gurnall, and
Traill. A generation of preachers arose who were very
orthodox, but painfully cold; very conscientious, but very
wanting in spirituality; very constant in their objections
to the Established Church, but very careless about spreading
vital Christianity.</p>

<p>I deeply feel the difficulty of conveying a correct impression
of the times when Whitefield lived. I dislike
over-statement as much as any one, but I am thoroughly
persuaded it is not easy to make an over-statement on this
branch of my subject.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>These were the times when the highest personages in
the realm lived openly in ways which were flatly contrary
to the law of God, and no man rebuked them. No courts,
I suppose, can be imagined more diametrically unlike
than the courts of George I. and George II., and the
court of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>These were the times when profligacy and irreligion
were reputable and respectable things. Judging from
the description we have of men and manners in those
days, a gentleman might have been defined as a creature
who got drunk, gambled, swore, fought duels, and broke
the seventh commandment incessantly. And for all this,
no one thought the worse of him.</p>

<p>These were the days when the men whom kings delighted
to honor were Bolingbroke, Chesterfield, Walpole,
and Newcastle. To be an infidel or a skeptic, to obtain
power by intrigue, and to retain power by the grossest
and most notorious bribery, were considered no disqualifications
at this era. Such was the utter want of religion,
morality, and high principle in the land, that men such
as these were not only tolerated, but praised.</p>

<p>These were the days when Hume, the historian, put
forth his work, became famous, and got a pension. He
was notoriously an infidel. These were the days when
Sterne and Swift wrote their clever, but most indecent
productions. Both were clergymen, and high in the
Church; but the public saw no harm. These were the
days when Fielding and Smollet were the popular authors,
and the literary taste of high and low was suited
by Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, Joseph Andrews,
and Tom Jones.</p>

<p>These were the days when Knox says, in his history
of Christian Philosophy: "Some of the most learned
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
men&mdash;the most voluminous writers on theological subjects&mdash;were
<i>totally ignorant of Christianity</i>. They were
ingenious heathen philosophers, assuming the name of
Christians, and forcibly paganizing Christianity, for the
sake of pleasing the world." These were the days when
Archbishop Drummond (1760) could talk of "intricate
and senseless questions, about the influence of the Spirit
the power of grace, predestination, imputed righteousness,
justification without works, and other opinions which
have from the beginning perplexed and perverted, debased,
defiled, and wounded Christianity." These were the days
when Bishop Warburton considered the teaching office
of the Holy Ghost to be completed in the Holy Scriptures,
and that his sanctifying and comforting offices are
chiefly confined to charity. Such were the leading
ministers. What must the mass of teachers have been!
Such were the <i>priests</i> of Whitefield's time. What must
have been the <i>people</i>!</p>

<p>These were the days when there was an utter dearth
of sound theological writing. The doctrines of the Reformers
were trampled under foot by men who sat in
their chairs. The bread of the Church was eaten by
men who flatly contradicted her Articles. The appetite
of religious people was satisfied with "Tillotson's Sermons,"
and the "Whole Duty of Man." A pension of
two hundred pounds a year was actually given to Blair,
of Edinburgh, for writing his most unchristian sermons.
Ask any theological bookseller, and he will tell you that,
generally speaking, no divinity is so worthless as that of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In fine, these were the days when there was no Society
for promoting the increase of true religion, but the
Christian Knowledge Society, and the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel. And even their work was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
comparatively trifling. Nothing was done for the Jew.
Nothing was done for the heathen. Nothing, almost,
was done for the colonies. Nothing was done for the
destitute parts of our own country. Nothing was done
for education. The Church slept. The dissenters slept.
The pulpit slept. The religious press slept. The gates
were left wide open. The walls were left unguarded.
Infidelity stalked in. The Devil sowed tares broadcast,
and walked to and fro. The gentry gloried in their
shame, and no man pointed out their wickedness. The
people sinned with a high hand, and no man taught them
better. Ignorance, profligacy, irreligion, and superstition,
were to be seen every where. Such were the times
when Whitefield was raised up.</p>

<p>I know that this is a dreadful picture. I marvel God
did not sweep away the Church altogether. But I believe
that the picture is not one whit too highly colored.
It is painful to expose such a state of things. But, for
Whitefield's sake, the truth ought to be known. Justice
has not been done to him, because the condition of the
times he lived in is not considered. The times he lived
in were extraordinary times, and required extraordinary
means to be used. And whatever quiet men, sitting by
their fireside in our day, may say to the contrary, I am
satisfied that Whitefield was just the man for his times.</p>

<hr style="width:35%" />

<p>2. The story of Whitefield's life, which forms the next
part of our subject, is one that is soon told. The facts
and incidents of that life are few and simple, and I shall
not dwell upon them at any length.</p>

<p>Whitefield was born in 1714. Like many other great
men, he was of very humble origin. His father and
mother kept the Bell Inn, in the city of Gloucester.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
Whether there is such an inn now, I do not know.
But, judging from Whitefield's account of his circumstances,
it must formerly have been a very small concern.</p>

<p>Whitefield's early life seems to have been any thing
but religious, though he had occasional fits of devout
feeling. He speaks of himself as having been addicted
to lying, filthy talking, and foolish jesting. He confesses
that he was a Sabbath-breaker, a theatre-goer, a card-player,
and a romance-reader. All this went on till he
was twelve or fifteen years old.</p>

<p>At the age of twelve he was placed at a grammar-school
in Gloucester. Little is known of his progress
there, excepting the curious fact that even then he was
remarkable for his good elocution and memory, and was
selected to make speeches before the corporation, at their
annual visitations.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen he appears to have become tired
of Latin and Greek, and to have given up all hopes of
ever becoming more than a tradesman. He ceased to
take lessons in any thing but writing. He began to
assist his mother in the public-house that she kept. "At
length," he says, "I put on my blue apron, washed mops,
cleaned rooms, and, in one word, became a professed
common drawer for nigh a year and a half."</p>

<p>But God, who ordereth all things in heaven and earth,
and called David from keeping sheep to be a king, had
provided some better thing for Whitefield than the office
of a pot-boy. Family disagreements interfered with his
prospects at the Bell Inn. An old schoolfellow stirred
up again within him the desire of going to the University.
And at length, after several providential circumstances
had smoothed the way, he was launched, at the
age of eighteen, at Oxford, in a position at that time
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
much more humbling than it is now, as a servitor at
Pembroke College.</p>

<p>Whitefield's Oxford career seems to have been the
turning-point in his life. According to his own journal,
he had not been without religious convictions for two or
three years before he went to Oxford. From the time
of his entering Pembroke College, these convictions
rapidly ripened into decided Christianity. He became
marked for his attendance on all means of grace within
his reach. He spent his leisure time in visiting the city
prisons and doing good. He formed an acquaintance
with the famous John Wesley and his brother Charles,
which gave a color to the whole of his subsequent life.
At one time he seems to have had a narrow escape from
becoming a semi-papist, an ascetic, or a mystic. From
this he seems to have been delivered, partly by the advice
of wiser and more experienced Christians, and partly by
reading such books as Scougal's "Life of God in the
Soul of Man," Law's "Serious Call," Baxter's "Call to
the Unconverted," and Alleine's "Alarm to Unconverted
Sinners." At length, in 1736, at the early age of twenty-two,
he was ordained deacon by Bishop Benson, of
Gloucester, and began to run that ministerial race in
which he never drew breath till he was laid in the grave.</p>

<p>His first sermon was preached in St. Mary-le-Crypt,
Gloucester. It was said to have driven fifteen persons
mad. Bishop Benson remarked, that he only hoped the
madness might continue. He next accepted temporary
duty at the Tower Chapel, London. While engaged
there, he preached continually in many of the London
churches, and among others, in the parish churches of Islington,
Bishopsgate, St. Dunstan's, St. Margaret, Westminster,
and Bow, Cheapside. From the very beginning
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
he attained a degree of popularity such as no preacher,
probably, before or since, has ever reached. To say that
the churches were crowded when he preached, would be
saying little. They were literally crammed to suffocation.
An eye-witness said, "You might have walked on the
people's heads."</p>

<p>From London he removed for a few months to Dummer,
a little rural parish in Hampshire, near Basingstoke.
From Dummer he sailed for the colony of Georgia, in
North America, after visiting Gloucester and Bristol, and
preaching in crowded churches in each place. The object
of his voyage was to assist the Wesleys in the care of
an Orphan House which they had established in Georgia
for the children of colonists who died there. The management
of this Orphan House ultimately devolved
entirely on Whitefield, and entailed on him a world of
responsibility and anxiety all his life long. Though well
meant, it seems to have been a design of very questionable
wisdom.<a name="FNanchor1" id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote1" id="Footnote1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
This Orphan House at Savannah is now in a flourishing condition,
and of great usefulness.</p></div>

<p>Whitefield returned from Georgia after about two
years' absence, partly to obtain priest's orders, which
were conferred on him by Bishop Benson, and partly on
business connected with the Orphan House. And now
we reach the era in his life when he was obliged, by
circumstances, to take up a line of conduct as a minister
which he probably at one time never contemplated, but
which was made absolutely necessary by the treatment
he received.</p>

<p>It appears that, on arriving in London after his first
visit to Georgia, he found the countenances of many of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
the clergy no longer towards him as they were before.
They had taken fright at some expressions in his published
letters, and some reports of his conduct in America.
They were scandalized at his preaching the doctrine of
regeneration in the way that he did, as a thing which
many of their parishioners needed. The pulpits of many
churches were flatly refused to him. Churchwardens,
who had no eyes for heresy and drunkenness, were filled
with virtuous indignation about what they called breaches
of order. Bishops who could tolerate Arianism and
Socinianism, got into a state of excitement about a man
who simply preached the gospel, and put forth warnings
against fanaticism and enthusiasm. In short, Whitefield's
field of usefulness within the Church was rapidly
narrowed on every side.</p>

<p>The step which seems to have decided Whitefield's
course of action at this period of his life, was his adoption
of open-air preaching. He had gone to Islington, on a
Sunday in April, 1739, to preach for the vicar, his
friend, Mr. Stonehouse. In the midst of the prayers, the
churchwarden came to him, and demanded his license
for preaching in the London diocese. This Whitefield,
of course, had not got, any more than any clergyman not
regularly officiating in the diocese has at this day. The
upshot of the matter was, that being forbidden to preach
in the pulpit, he went outside, after the service, and
preached in the churchyard. From that day, he regularly
took up the practice of open-air preaching. Wherever
there were large open fields around London; wherever
there were large bands of idle, church-despising, Sabbath-breaking
people gathered together&mdash;there went Whitefield
and lifted up his voice. The gospel so proclaimed
was listened to, and greedily received by hundreds who
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
had never dreamed of visiting a place of worship. In
Moorfields, in Hackney Fields, in Mary-le-bone Fields,
in May Fair, in Smithfield, on Kennington Common, on
Blackheath, Sunday after Sunday, Whitefield preached to
admiring masses. Ten thousand, fifteen thousand, twenty
thousand, thirty thousand, were computed sometimes to
have heard him at once. The cause of pure religion,
beyond doubt, was advanced. Souls were plucked from
the hand of Satan, as brands from the burning. But it
was going much too fast for the Church of those days.
The clergy, with very few exceptions, would have nothing
to do with this strange preacher. In short, the
ministrations of Whitefield in the pulpits of the Establishment,
with an occasional exception, from this time
ceased. He loved the Church. He gloried in her
Articles and Formularies. He used her Prayer Book
with delight. But the Church did not love him, and
so lost the use of his services. The plain truth is, the
Church of England of that day was not ready for a man
like Whitefield. The Church was too much asleep to
understand him.</p>

<p>From this date to the day of his death, a period of
thirty-one years, Whitefield's life was one uniform employment.
From Sunday morning to Saturday night&mdash;from
the 1st of January to the 31st of December&mdash;excepting
when laid aside by illness, he was almost incessantly
preaching. There was hardly a considerable
town in England, Scotland, and Wales, that he did not
visit. When churches were opened to him, he gladly
preached in churches. When chapels only were offered,
he cheerfully preached in chapels. When church and
chapel alike were closed, he was ready and willing
to preach in the open air. For thirty-four years he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
labored in this way, always proclaiming the same glorious
gospel, and always, as far as a man's eye can judge,
with immense effect. In one single Whitsuntide week,
after he had been preaching in Moorfields, he received
one thousand letters from people under spiritual concern,
and admitted to the Lord's table three hundred and
fifty persons. In the thirty-four years of his ministry, it
is reckoned that he preached publicly eighteen thousand
times.</p>

<p>His <i>journeyings</i> were prodigious, when the roads and
conveyances of his times are considered. Fourteen times
did he visit Scotland. Seven times did he cross the
Atlantic, backward and forward. Twice he went over to
Ireland. As to England and Wales, he traversed every
county in them, from the Isle of Wight to Berwick-on-Tweed,
and from the Land's End to the North Foreland.</p>

<p>His <i>regular ministerial work</i> in London, when he was
not journeying, was prodigious. His weekly engagements
at the Tabernacle in Tottenham-court Road,
which was built for him when the pulpits of the Established
Church were closed, were as follows:&mdash;Every
Sunday morning he administered the Lord's Supper to
several hundred communicants, at half-past six. After
this he read prayers, and preached, both morning and
afternoon; preached again in the evening at half-past five;
and concluded, by addressing a large society of widows,
married people, young men and spinsters, all sitting
separately in the area of the Tabernacle, with exhortations
suitable to their respective stations. On Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday mornings, he preached
regularly at six. On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Saturday evenings, he delivered lectures.
This you will observe made thirteen sermons a week.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
And all this time he was carrying on a correspondence
with people in almost every part of the world.</p>

<p>That any human frame could so long endure the labor
he went through, does indeed seem wonderful. That
his life was not shortened by violence, is no less wonderful.
Once he was nearly stoned to death by a Popish
mob in Dublin. Once he was nearly murdered in bed by
an angry lieutenant of the navy at Plymouth. Once he
narrowly escaped being stabbed by the sword of a rakish
young gentleman in Moorfields; but he was immortal till
his work was done. He died at last at Newburyport,
in North America, from a fit of asthma, at the age
of fifty-six. His last sermon was preached only twenty-four
hours before his death. It was an open-air discourse
two hours long. Like Bishop Jewell, he almost died
preaching. He left no children. He was once married,
and the marriage does not seem to have contributed
much to his happiness. But he left a name far better
than that of sons and daughters. Never, I believe, was
there a man of whom it could be so truly said, that he
spent and was spent for God.</p>

<hr style="width:35%" />

<p>3. The story of <i>Whitefield's religion</i> is the next part
of the subject that I proposed to take up, and unquestionably
it is one of no little interest.</p>

<p>What sort of doctrine did this wonderful man preach?
an inquirer may reasonably ask. What were the standards
of faith to which he adhered under the Bible?
What were the peculiar essentials of this religious teaching
of his, which was so universally spoken against in his
day?</p>

<p>The answer to all these questions is short and simple.
Whitefield was a real, genuine son of the Church of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
England. As such he was brought up in early youth.
As such he was educated at Oxford. As such he preached
as long as he was allowed to preach within the
Establishment. As such he preached when he was
outside. References to the Prayer Book, Articles, and
Homilies, abound in all his writings and sermons. His
constant reply to his numerous opponents was, that HE
at any rate was consistent with the formularies of his own
Church, and that <span class="smcap">they</span> were not. It is not at all too much
to say, that when practically cast out of the Establishment,
Whitefield was an infinitely better churchman than
ten thousand of the men who received the tithes of the
Church of England, and remained comfortably behind.</p>

<p>Whitefield no doubt was not a churchman of the
stamp of Archbishop Laud and his school. He was not
the man to put a Romish interpretation on our excellent
Formularies, and to place Church and sacraments
before Christ. He was not a churchman of the stamp
of Tillotson and the school that followed him. He did
not lay aside justification by faith, and the need of grace,
for semi-heathen disquisitions about morality and duty,
virtue and vice. And he was quite right. Laud and his
followers went infinitely beyond the doctrines of our
Church. Tillotson and his school fell infinitely below.</p>

<p>But if a churchman is a man who reads the Articles,
and Liturgy, and Homilies, in the sense of the men who
compiled them&mdash;if a churchman is a man who sympathizes
with Cranmer, and Latimer, and Hooper, and
Jewell&mdash;if a churchman is a man who honors doctrines
and ordinances in the order and proportion that the
Thirty-nine Articles honor them&mdash;if this be the true
definition of a churchman, then Whitefield was the highest
style of churchman&mdash;as true a churchman as ever breathed.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
And as for Whitefield's adversaries, they were little
better than shams and impostors. They had place and
power on their side, but they scarcely deserve to be called
churchmen at all.</p>

<p>Perhaps no better test of Whitefield's religious opinions
can be supplied, than the list of authors in divinity
which he wrote out for the use of a college connected
with his Orphan House in Georgia. Of churchmen, this
List includes the names of Archbishop Leighton, Bishop
Hall, and Burkitt; of Puritans, Pool, Owen, and Bunyan;
of Dissenters, Matthew Henry and Doddridge; of
Scotch Presbyterians, Wilson and Boston. All these are
men whose praise is even now in all the churches. These,
let us understand, were the kind of men with whom he
was of one mind in doctrine.</p>

<p>As to the substance of Whitefield's theological teaching,
the simplest account I can give of it is, that it was
purely <i>evangelical</i>. There were four main things that
he never lost sight of in his sermons. These four were:
man's complete ruin by sin, and consequent natural corruption
of heart; man's complete redemption by Christ,
and complete justification before God by faith in Christ;
man's need of regeneration by the Spirit, and entire renewal
of heart and life; and man's utter want of any
title to be considered a living Christian, unless he is dead
to sin and lives a holy life.</p>

<p>Whitefield had no notion of flattering men, and speaking
smooth things to them, merely because they were
baptized and called Christians, and sometimes came to
church. He only looked at one prominent feature in the
thousands he saw around him; and that was, the general
character of their lives. He saw the lives of these
multitudes were utterly contradictory to the Bible, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
utterly at variance with the principles of the Church to
which they professed to belong. He waited for nothing
more. He looked for no further evidence. He judged
of trees by their fruits. He told these thousands at once
that they were in danger of being lost for ever&mdash;that
they were in the broad way that leads to destruction&mdash;that
they were dead, and must be made alive again&mdash;that
they were lost, and must be found. He told them
that if they loved life, they must immediately repent&mdash;they
must become new creatures&mdash;they must be converted,
they must be <i>born again</i>. And I believe the
apostles would have done just the same.</p>

<p>But Whitefield was just as full and explicit in setting
forth the way to heaven as he was in setting forth the
way to hell. When he saw that men's consciences were
pricked and their fears aroused, he would open the treasure-house
of gospel mercy, and spread forth before a
congregation its unsearchable stores. He would unfold
to them the amazing love of God the Father to a fallen
world&mdash;that love from which he gave his only-begotten
Son, and on account of which, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us. He would show them the
amazing love of God the Son in taking our nature on
him, and suffering for us, the just for the unjust. He
would tell them of Jesus able to save to the uttermost all
that would come to God by him&mdash;Jesus and his everlasting
righteousness, in which the vilest sinners might
stand complete and perfect before the throne of God&mdash;Jesus
and the blood of sprinkling, which could wash the
blackest sins away&mdash;Jesus, the High Priest, waiting to
receive all who would come to him, and not only mighty,
but ready to save. And all this glorious salvation, he
would tell men, was close to them. It was not far above
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
them, like heaven. It was not deep beneath them, like
hell. It was near at hand. It was within their reach.
He would urge them at once to accept it. The man that
felt his sins and desired deliverance had only to believe
and be saved, to ask and receive, to wash and be clean.
And was he not right to say so? I believe the apostles
would have said much the same.</p>

<p>But while Whitefield addressed the careless and ungodly
masses in this style, he never failed to urge on
those who made a high profession of religion their responsibility,
and to stir them up to walk worthy of their
high calling. He never tolerated men who talked well
about religion, but lived inconsistent lives. Such men,
no doubt, there were about him, but it is pretty certain
they got no quarter from him. On the contrary, one of
his biographers tells us that he was especially careful to
impress on all the members of his congregation the absolute
necessity of adorning the doctrine of God in all
the relations of life. Masters and servants, rich people and
poor, old and young, married and single, each and all were
plainly exhorted to glorify God in their respective positions.
One day he would tell the young men of his
congregation to beware of being like one he heard of,
whose uncle described him as such a jumble of religion
and business, that he was fit for neither. Another day
he would hold up the example of a widow, remarkable
for her confidence in God. Another day he would say
to them, "God convert you more and more every hour
of the day; God convert you from lying in bed in the
morning; God convert you from lukewarmness; God
convert you from conformity to the world!" Another
day he would warn young men against leaving
their religion behind them as they rose in the world.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
"Beware," he would say, "of being golden apprentices,
silver journeymen, and copper masters." In
short, there never was a greater mistake than to suppose
there was any thing Antinomian or licentious in Whitefield's
teaching. It was discriminating, unquestionably.
Sinners had their portion; but saints had their portion
too. And what was this but walking in the very steps
of the apostle Paul?</p>

<p>The crowning excellence of Whitefield's teaching was,
that he just spoke of men, things, and doctrines, in the
way that the Bible speaks of them, and the place that
the Bible assigns to them. God, Christ, and the Spirit&mdash;sin,
justification, conversion, and sanctification&mdash;impenitent
sinners the most miserable of people&mdash;believing
saints the most privileged of people&mdash;the world a vain
and empty thing&mdash;heaven the only rest for an immortal
soul&mdash;the Devil a tremendous and ever-watchful foe&mdash;holiness
the only true happiness&mdash;hell a real and certain
portion for the unconverted; these were the kind of subjects
which filled Whitefield's mind, and formed the staple
of his ministry. To say that he undervalued the sacraments
would be simply false. His weekly communions
at the Tabernacle are an answer that speaks for itself.
But he never put the first things in Christianity second,
and the second first. He never put doctrine below sacraments,
and sacraments above doctrine. And who shall
dare to blame him for this? He only followed the proportion
of the Bible.</p>

<p>It is only fair to add, that Whitefield exemplified in
his practice the religion that he preached. He had
faults, unquestionably. I have not come here to make
him out a perfect being. He often erred in judgment.
He was often hasty, both with his tongue and with his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>
pen. He had no business to say that Archbishop Tillotson
knew no more of religion than Mahomet. He
was wrong to set down some people as the Lord's enemies,
and others as the Lord's friends, so precipitately as
he sometimes did. He was to blame for styling many
of the clergy letter-learned Pharisees, because they could
not receive the doctrine of the new birth. But still, after
all this has been said, there can be no doubt that, in the
main, he was a holy, self-denying, and consistent man.
Even his worst enemies can say nothing to the contrary.</p>

<p>He was, to the very end, a man of <i>eminent self-denial</i>.
His style of living was most simple. He refused money
when it was pressed upon him, and once to the amount
of £7000. He amassed no fortune. He founded no
wealthy family. The little money he left behind him at
his death was entirely from the legacies of friends.</p>

<p>He was a man of remarkable <i>disinterestedness</i> and
singleness of eye. He seemed to live for only two objects&mdash;the
glory of God, and the salvation of immortal
souls. He raised no party of followers who took his
name. He established no system, like Wesley, of which
his own writings should be cardinal elements. A frequent
expression of his is most characteristic of the man:
"Let the name of George Whitefield perish, so long as
Christ only is exalted."</p>

<p>Last, but not least, he was a man of <i>extraordinary
catholicity</i> and liberality in his religion. He knew nothing
of that narrow-minded policy which prompts a man to
fancy that every thing must be barren outside his own
camp, and that his party has got a monopoly of truth
and heaven. He loved all who loved the Lord Jesus
Christ in sincerity. He measured all by the measure
which the angels of God use&mdash;"did they possess repentance
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
towards God, faith towards the Lord Jesus
Christ, holiness of conversation?" If they did, they were
as his brethren. His soul was with such men, by whatever
name they were called. Minor differences were
wood, hay, and stubble to him. The marks of the Lord
Jesus were the only marks he cared for. This catholicity
is the more remarkable, when the spirit of the times he
lived in is considered. Even the Erskines, in Scotland,
wanted him to preach for no other denomination but their
own, viz., the Secession Church. He asked them, why
only for them; and received the notable answer, that
they were the Lord's people. This was more than
Whitefield could stand. He asked if there were no other
Lord's people but themselves. He told them, if all others
were the Devil's people, they certainly had more need to
be preached to. And he wound up by informing them,
that if the Pope himself would lend him his pulpit, he
would gladly proclaim the righteousness of Christ in it.
To this catholicity of spirit he adhered all his days.
And nothing could be a more weighty testimony against
all narrowness of spirit among believers, than his request
shortly before his death, that when he did die, John
Wesley might be asked to preach his funeral sermon.
Wesley and he had long ceased to see eye to eye on
Calvinistic points. But as Calvin <i>said</i> of Luther, so
Whitefield was resolved to <i>think</i> of Wesley. He was
determined to sink minor differences, and to know him
only as a good servant of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Such was George Whitefield's religion. Comment, I
hope, is needless upon it. Time, at any rate, forbids me
to dwell on it a moment longer. But surely I think I
have shown enough to justify me in expressing a wish
that we had many living ministers in the Church of England
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
like George Whitefield.</p>

<hr style="width:35%" />

<p>4. The next part of the subject is one which I feel
some difficulty in handling,&mdash;I allude to <i>Whitefield's
preaching</i>.</p>

<p>I find that this point is one on which much difference
of opinion prevails. I find many are disposed to think
that part of Whitefield's success is attributable to the
novelty of gospel doctrines at the time when he preached,
and part to the extraordinary gifts of voice and delivery
with which he was endowed, and that the matter and
style of his sermons were in no wise remarkable. From
this opinion I am inclined to dissent altogether. After
calm examination, I have come to the conclusion that
Whitefield was one of the most powerful and extraordinary
preachers the world has ever seen. My belief is,
that hitherto he has never been too highly estimated, and
that, on the contrary, he does not receive the credit he
deserves.</p>

<p>One thing is abundantly clear and beyond dispute, and
that is, that his sermons were wonderfully effective. No
preacher has ever succeeded in arresting the attention
of such enormous crowds of people as those he addressed
continually in the neighborhood of London. No preacher
has ever been so universally popular in every country he
visited, England, Scotland and America, as he was. No
preacher has ever retained his hold on his hearers so
entirely as he did for thirty-four years. His popularity
never waned. It was as great at the end of his
days as it was at the beginning. This of itself is a
great fact. To command the ear of people for thirty-four
long years, and be preaching incessantly the whole time
is something that the novelty of the gospel alone will
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
not account for. The theory that his preaching was
popular, because new, to my mind is utterly unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Another thing is no less indisputable about his preaching,
and that is, that it produced a powerful effect on
people in every rank of life. He won the suffrages of
high as well as low, of rich as well as poor, of learned as
well as unlearned. If his preaching had been popular
with none but the uneducated masses, we might have
thought it possible there was little in it except a striking
delivery and a loud voice. But facts are, unfortunately,
against this theory too; and, under the pressure of these
facts, it will be found to break down.</p>

<p>It is a fact, that numbers of the nobility and gentry of
Whitefield's day were warm admirers of his preaching.
The Marquis of Lothian, the Earl of Leven, the Earl of
Buchan, Lord Rae, Lord Dartmouth, Lord James A. Gordon,
might be named, among others, besides Lady
Huntingdon and a host of ladies.</p>

<p>It is a fact, that eminent statesmen, like Bolingbroke
and Chesterfield, were frequently his delighted hearers.
Even the artificial Chesterfield was known to warm
under Whitefield's eloquence. Bolingbroke has placed on
record his opinion, and said, "He is the most extraordinary
man in our times. He has the most commanding
eloquence I ever heard in any person."</p>

<p>It is a fact, that cool-headed men, like Hume the historian,
and Franklin the philosopher, spoke in no measured
terms of his preaching powers. Franklin has
written a long account of the effect his sermons produced
at Philadelphia. Hume declared that it was
worth going twenty miles to hear him.</p>

<p>Now these are facts&mdash;simple, historical, and well-authenticated
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
facts. What shall we say to them? I say
that these facts are quite enough to prove that Whitefield's
effectiveness was not owing entirely to delivery
and voice, as some men would have us believe. Bolingbroke
and Chesterfield, and Hume and Franklin, were
not such weak men as to allow their judgments to be
biased by any mere external endowments. They were
no mean judges of eloquence. They were, probably,
among the best qualified critics of the day. And I say
confidently, that their opinion can only be explained by
the fact, that Whitefield was indeed a most powerful and
extraordinary preacher.</p>

<p>But still, after all, the question remains to be answered,
What was the secret of Whitefield's unparalleled success
as a preacher? How are we to account for his sermons
producing effects which no sermons, before or after his
time, have ever yet done? These are questions you have
a right to ask. But they are questions I find it very
hard to answer. That his sermons were not mere voice
and rant, I think we have pretty clearly proved. That
he was a man of commanding intellect and grasp of
mind, no one has ever pretended to say. How then are
we to account for the effectiveness of his preaching?</p>

<p>The reader who turns for a solution of this question to
the seventy-five sermons published under his name, will
probably be much disappointed. He will not find in
them many striking thoughts. He will not discover in
them any new exhibitions of gospel doctrine. The plain
truth is, that by far the greater part of them were taken
down in short-hand by reporters, without Whitefield's
knowledge, and published without correction. No intelligent
reader, I think, can help discovering that these
reporters were, most unhappily, ignorant alike of stopping
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
and paragraphing, of grammar and of gospel. The consequence
is, that many passages in these sermons are
what Latimer would call a "mingle-mangle," or what
we should call in this day "a complete mess."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I am bold to say, that with all their
faults, Whitefield's printed sermons will repay a candid
perusal. Let the reader only remember what I have just
said, that most of them are miserably reported, paragraphed
and stopped, and make allowance accordingly.
Let him remember also, that English for speaking and
English for reading are two different languages; and
that sermons which preach well, always read ill. Remember
these two things, I say, and I do believe you
will find very much to admire in some of Whitefield's
sermons. For myself, I can only say, I believe I have
learned much from them, and, however great a heresy
against taste it may appear, I should be ungrateful if I
did not praise them.</p>

<p>And now let me try to point out to you what seem to
me to have been the characteristic features of Whitefield's
sermons. I may be wrong, but they appear to
me to present just such a combination of excellences as
is most likely to make an effective preacher.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you must remember, Whitefield
preached <i>a singularly pure gospel</i>. Few men ever gave
their hearers so much wheat and so little chaff. He did
not get into his pulpit to talk about his party, his cause,
his interest, or his office. He was perpetually telling you
about your sins, your heart, and Jesus Christ, in the way
that the Bible speaks of them. "Oh! the righteousness
of Jesus Christ!" he would frequently say: "I must be
excused if I mention it in almost all my sermons." This,
you may be sure, is the corner-stone of all preaching that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
God honors. It must be preëminently a <i>manifestation
of truth</i>.</p>

<p>For another thing, Whitefield's preaching was <i>singularly
lucid and simple</i>. You might not like his doctrine,
perhaps; but at any rate you could not fail to understand
what he meant. His style was easy, plain, and
conversational. He seemed to abhor long and involved
sentences. He always saw his mark, and went direct at
it. He seldom or never troubled his hearers with long
arguments and intricate reasonings. Simple Bible statements,
pertinent anecdotes, and apt illustrations, were
the more common weapons that he used. The consequence
was, that his hearers always understood him. He
never shot above their heads. Never did man seem to
enter so thoroughly into the wisdom of Archbishop
Usher's saying, "To make easy things seem hard is
easy, but to make hard things easy is the office of a
great preacher."</p>

<p>For another thing, Whitefield was a <i>singularly bold
and direct preacher</i>. He never used that indefinite expression,
"we," which seems so peculiar to English pulpit
oratory, and which leaves a hearer's mind in a state of
misty confusion as to the preacher's meaning. He met
men face to face, like one who had a message from God
to them&mdash;like an ambassador with tidings from heaven;
"I have come here to speak to you about your soul." He
never minced matters, and beat about the bush in attacking
prevailing sins. His great object seemed to be to discover
the dangers his hearers were most liable to, and
then fire right at their hearts. The result was, that hundreds
of his hearers used always to think that the sermons
were specially addressed to themselves. He was not content,
like many, with sticking on a tailpiece of application
at the end of a long discourse. A constant vein of application
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
run through all his sermons. "This is for you:
this is for you: and this is for you." His hearers were
never let alone. Nothing, however, was more striking
than his direct appeals to all classes of his congregation,
as he drew towards a conclusion. With all the fault of
his printed sermons, the conclusions of some of them are,
to my mind, the most stirring and heart-searching addresses
to souls that are to be found in the English
language.</p>

<p>Another striking feature in Whitefield's preaching was
his <i>thundering earnestness</i>. One poor, uneducated man
said of him that he "preached like a lion." Never,
perhaps, did any preacher so thoroughly succeed in showing
people that he, at least, believed all he was saying,
and that his whole heart, and soul, and strength, were
bent on making them believe it too. No man could say
that his sermons were like the morning and evening gun
at Portsmouth, a formal discharge, fired off as a matter
of course, that disturbs no body. They were all life.
They were all fire. There was no getting away from
under them. Sleep was next to impossible. You must
listen, whether you liked it or not. There was a holy
violence about him. Your attention was taken by storm.
You were fairly carried off your legs by his energy, before
you had time to consider what you would do. An
American gentleman once went to hear him, for the first
time, in consequence of the report he heard of his preaching
powers. The day was rainy, the congregation comparatively
thin, and the beginning of the sermon rather
heavy. Our American friend began to say to himself,
"This man is no great wonder, after all." He looked
round, and saw the congregation as little interested as
himself. One old man, in front of the pulpit, had fallen
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
asleep. But all at once Whitefield stopped short. His
countenance changed. And then he suddenly broke
forth in an altered tone: "If I had come to speak to you
in my own name, you might well rest your elbows on
your knees, and your heads on your hands, and sleep;
and once in a while look up and say, What is this babbler
talking of? But I have not come to you in my own
name. No! I have come to you in the name of the
Lord of Hosts," (here he brought down his hand and
foot with a force that made the building ring,) "and I
must and will be heard." The congregation started.
The old man woke up at once. "Ay, ay!" cried Whitefield,
fixing his eyes on him, "I have waked you up,
have I? I meant to do it. I am not come here to
preach to stocks and stones: I have come to you in
the name of the Lord God of Hosts, and I must and
will have an audience." The hearers were stripped of
their apathy at once. Every word of the sermon was
attended to. And the American gentleman never
forgot it.</p>

<p>Another striking feature in Whitefield's preaching was
his <i>singular power of description</i>. The Arabians have
a proverb which says, "He is the best orator who can
turn men's ears into eyes." If ever there was a speaker
who succeeded in doing this, it was Whitefield. He
drew such vivid pictures of the things he was dwelling
upon, that his hearers could believe they actually saw
them all with their own eyes, and heard them with their
own ears. "On one occasion," says one of his biographers,
"Lord Chesterfield was among his hearers. The
preacher, in describing the miserable condition of a poor,
benighted sinner, illustrated the subject by describing a
blind beggar. The night was dark; the road dangerous
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>
and full of snares. The poor sightless mendicant is
deserted by his dog near the edge of a precipice, and
has nothing to grope his way with but his staff. But
Whitefield so warmed with his subject, and unfolded it
with such graphic power, that the whole auditory was
kept in breathless silence over the movements of the poor
old man;" and, at length, when the beggar was about to
take that fatal step which would have hurled him down
the precipice to certain destruction, Lord Chesterfield
actually made a rush forward to save him, exclaiming
aloud, "He is gone! he is gone!" The noble lord had
been so entirely carried away by the preacher, that he
forgot the whole was a picture.</p>

<p>One more feature in Whitefield's preaching deserves
especial notice, and that is, the immense amount of
<i>pathos and feeling</i> which it always contained. It was
no uncommon thing with him to weep profusely in the
pulpit. Cornelius Winter goes so far as to say that he
hardly ever knew him get through a sermon without
tears. There seems to have been nothing whatever of
affectation in this. He felt intensely for the souls before
him, and his feeling found a vent in tears. Of all the
ingredients of his preaching, nothing, I suspect, was so
powerful as this. It awakened sympathies, and touched
secret springs in men, which no amount of intellect
could have moved. It melted down the prejudices which
many had conceived against him. They could not hate
the man who wept so much over their souls. They were
often so affected as to shed floods of tears themselves.
"I came to hear you," said one man, "intending to break
your head; but your sermon got the better of me&mdash;it
broke my heart." Once become satisfied that a man
loves you, and you will listen gladly to any thing he has
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>
got to say. And this was just one grand secret of
Whitefield's success.</p>

<p>And now I will only ask you to add to this feeble
sketch, that Whitefield's <i>action</i> was perfect&mdash;so perfect
that Garrick, the famous actor, gave it unqualified
praise&mdash;that his <i>voice</i> was as wonderful as his action&mdash;so
powerful, that he could make thirty thousand people
hear him at once; so musical and well-attuned, that men
said he could raise tears by his pronunciation of the
word "Mesopotamia:" that his <i>fluency</i> and command of
extemporaneous language were of the highest order,
prompting him always to use the right word and to put
it in the right place. Add, I say, these gifts to those
already mentioned, and then judge for yourselves whether
there is not sufficient, and more than sufficient, in our
hands, to account for his power as a preacher.</p>

<p>For my part, I say, unhesitatingly, that I believe no
living preacher ever possessed such a combination of excellences
as Whitefield. Some, no doubt, have surpassed
him in some of his gifts; others, perhaps, have been his
equals in others. But, for a combination of pure doctrine,
simple and lucid style, boldness and directness,
earnestness and fervor, descriptiveness and picture-drawing,
pathos and feeling&mdash;united with a perfect voice,
perfect delivery, and perfect command of words, Whitefield,
I repeat, stands alone. No man, dead or alive, I
believe, ever came alongside of him. And I believe you
will always find, that just in proportion as preachers have
approached that curious combination of excellences
which Whitefield possessed, just in that very proportion
have they attained what Clarendon defines true eloquence
to be, viz., "a strange power of making themselves
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>
believed."</p>

<hr style="width:35%" />

<p>5. And now, there only remains one more point connected
with Whitefield to which I wish to advert. I
fear that I shall have exhausted your attention already.
But the point is one of such importance, that it cannot
be passed over in silence. The point I mean is, the
actual <i>amount of real good</i> that Whitefield did.</p>

<p>You will, I hope, understand me, when I say, that the
materials for forming an opinion on this point in a history
like his, must necessarily be scanty. He founded no
denomination among whom his name was embalmed,
and his every act recorded, as did John Wesley. He
headed no mighty movement against a Church which
openly professed false doctrines, as Luther did against
Rome. He wrote no books which were to be the
religious classics of the million, like John Bunyan. He
was a simple, guileless man, who lived for one thing
only, and that was to preach Christ. If he succeeded in
doing that effectually, he cared for nothing else. He
did nothing to preserve the memory of his usefulness.
He left his work with the Lord.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many people who can see in
Whitefield nothing but a fanatic and enthusiast, There
is a generation that loathes every thing like zeal in
religion. There are never wanting men of a cautious,
cold-blooded, Erasmus-like temper, who pass through
the world doing no good, because they are so dreadfully
afraid of doing harm. I do not expect such men to
admire Whitefield, or allow he did any good. I fear, if
they had lived eighteen hundred years ago, they would
have had no sympathy with St. Paul.</p>

<p>Again, there are other people who count schism a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>
far greater crime than either heresy or false doctrine.
There is a generation of men who under no circumstances
will worship God out of their own parish: and
as to separation from the Church, they seem to think
that nothing whatever can justify it. I do not, of
course, expect such men to admire Whitefield or his
work. His principle evidently was, that it was far better
for men to be uncanonically saved than canonically
damned.</p>

<p>Whether by any other line of action Whitefield could
have remained in the Church, and retained his usefulness,
is a question which, at this distance of time, we are
very incompetent to answer. That he erred in temper
and judgment in his dealings with the bishops and
clergy, in many instances, I have no doubt. That he
raised up fresh bodies of separatists from the Church of
England, and made breaches which probably will never
be repaired, I have no doubt also. But still it must
never be forgotten, that the state of the Church was bad
enough to provoke a holy indignation. The old principle
is most true, that "he is the schismatic who causes the
separation, and not he who separates." <i>If Whitefield did
harm</i>, the harm ought to be laid on the Church which
compelled him to act as he did, quite as much as on him.
And when we come to strike the balance, I believe the
harm he may have done is outweighed by the good a
thousand-fold.</p>

<p>The truth, I believe, is, that the <i>direct good</i> Whitefield
did to immortal souls was enormous. I will go farther.
I believe it is incalculable. In Scotland, in England, in
America, credible witnesses have recorded their testimony
that he was the means of converting thousands of
souls.</p>

<p>Franklin, the philosopher, was a cold, calculating man,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
and not likely to speak too highly of any minister's work.
Yet even he confessed that it "was wonderful to see the
change soon made by his preaching in the manners of
the inhabitants of Philadelphia. From being thoughtless
or indifferent about religion, it seemed as if all the
world were growing religious."</p>

<p>Maclaurin and Willison were Scotch ministers, whose
names are well-known to theological readers, and stand
deservedly high. Both of them have testified that
Whitefield did an amazing work in Scotland. Willison,
in particular, says: "That God honored him with surprising
success among sinners of all ranks and persuasions."</p>

<p>Old Venn, in our own Church, was a man of strong
common sense, as well as great grace. His opinion was,
that "if the greatness, extent, success, and disinterestedness
of a man's labors can give him distinction among
the children of Christ, then we are warranted to affirm,
that scarce any one has equalled Mr. Whitefield."
Again, he says, "It is a well-known fact, that the conversion
of men's souls has been the fruit of a single
sermon from his lips, so eminently was he made a fisher
of men." And again, "Though we are allowed to sorrow
that we shall never see or hear him again, we must
still rejoice that millions have heard him so long, so
often, and to such good effect; and that out of this mass
of people, multitudes are gone before him to hail his
entrance into the world of glory."</p>

<p>John Newton was a shrewd man, as well as an eminent
minister of the gospel. His testimony is, "I am
not backward to say, that I have not read or heard of
any person, since the apostles' days, of whom it may
more emphatically he said, he was a burning and a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
shining light, than the late Mr. Whitefield, whether we
consider the warmth of his zeal, the greatness of his
ministerial talents, or the extensive usefulness with which
the Lord honored him."</p>

<p>These are not solitary testimonies. I might add
many more if time permitted. Romaine did not agree
with him in many things, yet what does he say of him?
"We have none left to succeed him; none, of his gifts;
none, any thing like him in usefulness." Toplady was a
tremendously high Calvinist, and not disposed to overestimate
the number of saved souls. Yet he says,
Whitefield's ministry was "attended with spiritual benefit
to tens of thousands;" and he styles him "the
apostle of the British empire, and the prince of preachers."
Hervey was a quiet, literary man, whose health
seldom allowed him to quit the retirement of Weston
Favell. But he says of Whitefield, "I never beheld so
fair a copy of our Lord, such a living image of the
Saviour. I cannot forbear applying the wise man's
encomiums of an illustrious woman to this eminent
minister of the everlasting gospel: 'Many sons have
done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.'"</p>

<p>But if the amount of direct good that Whitefield did
in the world was great, who shall tell us the amount of
<i>good that he did indirectly</i>? I believe it never can be
reckoned up. I suspect it will never be fully known
until the last day.</p>

<p>Whitefield was among the first <i>who stirred up a zeal
for the pure gospel among the clergy and laity of our
own Church</i>. His constant assertion of pure Reformation
principles&mdash;his repeated references to the Articles,
Prayer Book, and Homilies&mdash;his never-answered challenges
to his opponents to confute him out of the Formularies
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
of their own communion&mdash;all this must have produced
an effect, and set many thinking. I have no doubt
whatever, that many a faithful minister, who became a
shining light in those days within the Church of England,
first lighted his candle at the lamp of a man outside.</p>

<p>Whitefield, again, was among the first to <i>show the
right way to meet infidels and skeptics</i>. He saw clearly
that the most powerful weapon against such men is not
metaphysical reasoning and critical disquisition; but
preaching the whole gospel, living the whole gospel,
and spreading the whole gospel. It was not the writings
of Leland, and the younger Sherlock, and Waterland, and
Leslie, that rolled back the flood of infidelity one half so
much as the preaching of Whitefield, and Wesley, and
Fletcher, and Romaine, and Berridge, and Venn. Had
it not been for them, I firmly believe we might have had
a counterpart of the French Revolution in our own
land. They were the men who were the true champions
of Christianity. Infidels are seldom shaken by mere
abstract reasoning. The surest arguments against them
are gospel truth and gospel life.</p>

<p>To crown all, Whitefield was the very first who seems
thoroughly to have understood what Chalmers has called
the <i>aggressive system</i>. He did not wait for souls to
come to him, but he went after souls. He did not sit
tamely by his fireside, mourning over the wickedness of
the land. He went forth to beard the Devil in his high
places. He attacked sin and wickedness face to face, and
gave them no peace. He dived into holes and corners
after sinners. He hunted up ignorance and vice, wherever
it could be found. He showed that he thoroughly
realized the nature of the ministerial office. Like
a fisherman, he did not wait for the fish to come to him. Like
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
a fisherman, he used every kind of means to catch souls.
Men know a little more of this now than they did formerly.
City Missions and District Visiting Societies are evidences
of clearer views. But let us remember this was
all comparatively new in Whitefield's time, and let us
give him the credit he deserves.</p>

<p>In short, I come to the conclusion that no man has
ever done more good in his day and generation than the
man who is the subject of this lecture. He was a true
hero, and that in its highest and best sense. He did a
work that will stand the fire, and glorify God, when
many other works are forgotten. And for that work I
believe that England owes a debt to his character which
England has never yet paid.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p>And now, I hasten to a conclusion. I have set before
you, to the best of my ability, Whitefield's time, and life,
and religion, and preaching, and actual work. I have
not extenuated his faults, to the best of my knowledge.
I have not exaggerated his good qualities, so far as I am
aware. It only remains for me to point out to you two
great practical lessons which the subject appears to me to
teach.</p>

<p>Learn then, I beseech you, for one lesson, the <i>amazing
power that one single man possesses</i>, when he is determined
to work for God, and has got truth on his side.</p>

<p>Here is a man who starts in life with every thing, to
all appearance, against him. He has neither family, nor
place, nor money, nor high connections on his side. His
views are flatly opposed to the customs and prejudices of
his time. He stands in direct opposition to the stream
of public taste, and the religion of the vast bulk of ministers
around him. He is as much isolated and alone, to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
all appearance, as Martin Luther opposing the Pope, as
Athanasius resisting the Arians, as Paul on Mars' Hill.
And yet this man stands his ground. He arrests public
attention. He gathers crowds around him who receive
his teaching. He is made a blessing to tens of thousands.
He turns the world upside down. How striking these
facts are!</p>

<p>Here is your <i>encouragement</i>, if you stand alone. You
have no reason to be cast down and faint-hearted. You
are not weak, though few, if God is with you. There is
nothing too great to be done by a little company, if only
they have Christ on their side. Away with the idea
that numbers alone have power! Cast away the old
vulgar error that majorities alone have strength. Get
firm hold of the great truth that minorities always move
the world. Think of the little flock that our Lord left
behind him, and the one hundred and twenty names in
that upper chamber in Jerusalem, who went forth to
assault the heathen world! Think of George Whitefield
assailing boldly the ungodliness which deluged all around
him, and winning victory after victory! Think of all
this. Cast fear away. Lay out your talents heartily and
confidently for God.</p>

<p>Here also is your <i>example</i>, if you desire to do good to
souls. Whether you become ministers or missionaries or
teachers, never forget you must fight with Whitefield's
weapons, if you wish to have any portion of Whitefield's
success. Never forget what John Wesley said was Whitefield's
theology&mdash;"Give God all the glory of whatever is
good in man: set Christ as high and man as low as
possible, in the business of salvation. All merit is in the
blood of Christ, and all power is from the Spirit of Christ."</p>

<p>Think not for a moment that earnestness alone will
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
insure success. This is a huge delusion. It will do
nothing of the kind. All the earnestness in the world
will never enable a teacher of <i>German theology</i> to show
you one Tinnevelly, or a teacher of <i>semi-Popery</i> one
Sierra Leone. Oh, no! it must be the simple, pure, unadulterated
gospel that you must carry with you, if you
are to do good. You must sow as Whitefield sowed, or
you will never reap as he reaped.</p>

<p>Learn, in the last place, <i>what abundant reasons we
have for thankfulness in the present condition of the
Church of England</i>.</p>

<p>We are far too apt to look at the gloomy side of
things around us, and at that only. We are all prone to
dwell on the faults of our condition, and to forget to
bless God for our mercies. There are many things we
could wish otherwise in our beloved Church, beyond all
question. There are defects we could wish to see remedied,
and wounds we should gladly see healed. But
still, let us look behind us, and compare the Church of
our day with the Church of Whitefield's times. Look
on this picture, and on that, and I am sure, if you do so
honestly and fairly, you will agree with me that we have
reason to be thankful.</p>

<p>We have <i>bishops</i> on the bench now, who love the
simple truth as it is in Jesus, and are ready to help forward
good works&mdash;bishops who are not ashamed to
come forward in Exeter Hall, and lend their aid to the
extension of Christ's gospel&mdash;bishops who would have
welcomed a man like Whitefield, and found full occupation
for his marvellous gifts. Let us thank God for this.
It was not so a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>We have hundreds of <i>clergymen</i> in our parishes
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>
now, who preach as full a gospel as Whitefield did,
though they may not do it with the same power&mdash;clergymen
who are not ashamed of the doctrine of
regeneration, and do not pronounce a minister a heretic,
because he says to ungodly people, "Ye must be born
again." Let us thank God for this. A man need not
travel many miles now in order to find parishes where
the gospel is preached. When driven out of one parish
church, he can find truth in another. It was not so a
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>We have thousands of <i>laymen</i> now, who are fully
alive to the duties and responsibilities of members of a
Protestant Church&mdash;laymen who rejoice in holding up
the hands of evangelical ministers, and are righteously
jealous for the maintenance and extension of evangelical
truth. Let us thank God for this. It was not so a
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>We have <i>societies and agencies</i> for evangelizing every
dark corner of the earth in connection with our Church.
We have wide and effectual doors of usefulness for all
who are willing to labor in the Lord's vineyard. The
difficulty now is, not so much to find openings for doing
good, as to find men. Let us thank God for this. It
was not so a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Young men of the Church of England, I ask you
to gather up these facts, and treasure them in your
memories. They are facts. They cannot be gainsaid.
Treasure them up, I repeat. Look back a century, and
then look around you, and then judge for yourselves
whether you ought not to be thankful.</p>

<p>Beware, I beseech you, of that tribe of men who would
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
fain persuade you to forsake the Church of England, and
separate from her communion. There is a generation
of murmurers and complainers in the present day, who
seem to revel in picking holes&mdash;a generation that seems
to forget that fault-finding is the easiest task in all the
world&mdash;a generation that has no eyes to see the healthy
parts in our body ecclesiastic, but has a wonderfully
quick and morbid scent for detecting its sores&mdash;a generation
that is mighty to scatter, but impotent to build&mdash;a
generation that would persuade churchmen to strain
at gnats, but finds no difficulty itself in swallowing
camels&mdash;a generation that would have you pull the
old house down, but cannot offer you so much as a tent
in its place: of all such men, I say solemnly and affectionately&mdash;of
all such men, I warn you to beware.
Listen not to them. Have no friendship with them.
Avoid them. Turn from them. Pass away.</p>

<p>Let us not leave the good old ship, the <span class="smcap">Church of
England</span>, until we have some better reason than can at
present be seen. What though she be old and weather-beaten!
What though, in some respects, she may want
repair! What though some of the crew be not to be
depended on! Still, with all her faults, the old ship is
in far better trim than she was a century ago. Let us
acknowledge her faults, and hope they may yet be
amended. But still, with all her faults, let us stick by
the ship!</p>

<p>When the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England
are repealed, and the Prayer Book and Homilies
so altered as to be unprotestantized&mdash;when regeneration
and justification by faith are forbidden to be preached in
her pulpits&mdash;when the Queen, Lords and Commons,
and laity, have assented to these changes&mdash;in short,
when the Gospel is driven out of the Establishment&mdash;then,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>
and not till then, it will be time for you and me to
go out; but, till then, I say, <span class="smcap">Let us stick by the
Church!</span></p>
